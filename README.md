# clear-my-desktop

A simple Windows tool to clear your desktop. It creates a folder in the user's `Documents` directory with today's date (e.g, "31 Aug 2023") and **moves** all the files and folders from the desktop to that newly created folder.

# Building
- Download/clone `main.cpp`
- Run `g++ main.cpp -O3 -o clear-my-desktop`
